  1. Read the first question. Make sure you pay attention to what it is asking.
  1. Make sure to go back to the passage and find evidence to prove your answer.
  1. **Process of Elimination (POE)**: Whenever you see an answer choice that does not work, cross it out.

### Homework Corrections:
Questions 1-31 of the following practice test, untimed. Please make sure you print out the test if possible, and check that they are underlining passages and physically crossing out answer choices. Following and learning the process is more important than simply completing the homework! We will correct the homework together in class.
