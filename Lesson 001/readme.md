**Introduction**: What is each student's past experience with the SAT Reading Comprehension section? What parts of this test feel easier, and what parts feel more difficult?

The following is an SAT Practice test. Please open the link for us to discuss the structure of the Reading Comprehension section: [PRACTICE TEST 1](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/sat-practice-test-1-digital.pdf)

#### SAT Reading Comprehension Structure
  - 65 minutes
  - 52 questions

#### SAT Writing and Language Structure
  - 35 minutes
  - 44 question

#### Process for completing a Reading Comprehension passage:
  1. Read the passage first (not the questions).
  1. While reading the passage, underline important parts. Circle key dates, people, and other proper nouns. These will be important landmarks for you when answering questions.
  1. Read the first question. Make sure you pay attention to what it is asking.
  1. Make sure to go back to the passage and find evidence to prove your answer.
  1. **Process of Elimination (POE)**: Whenever you see an answer choice that does not work, cross it out.

#### How is the SAT scored?
Should you guess on questions you do not know? Do you “lose” points for guessing on a question (rather than just leaving it blank?)

### Felix:
- Do you look at questions first, or do you read the passage first?
  - Look at the questions first.
- What are strategies you can use while reading the passage?
  - Underline important parts.
- What do you do if there is a question you do not know?
  - Narrow down the questions and then guess the answer.

#### Clara:
- Do you look at questions first, or do you read the passage first?
  - Read the passage first and then look at the questions.
- What are strategies you can use while reading the passage?
  - You can solve for unknown words and figure out the key details.
- What do you do if there is a question you do not know?
  - Try to solve it one more time, but, if you still have trouble with it, guess the answer.

#### Ruby:
- Do you look at questions first, or do you read the passage first?
  - I look at the passage first.
- What are strategies you can use while reading the passage?
  - Looking for keywords
  - Skim the passage, to save time.
- What do you do if there is a question you do not know?
  - You can guess after you eliminate the ones you know for sure that aren’t correct.

#### Kingston:
- Do you look at questions first, or do you read the passage first?
  * I look at the questions first because there might be some that you can answer without looking at the passage, or just a little bit. For example, if it asks for the POV, you can just look at a few sentences and know.
- What are strategies you can use while reading the passage?
  * You could throw away useless information that you don’t need. For example, if you are trying to figure out how someone is feeling, you won’t need to know the color of the pencil.
- What do you do if there is a question you do not know?
  * You can guess if it’s multiple choice, and just write what you think it is for writing questions.
